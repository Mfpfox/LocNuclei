# LocNuclei

LocNuclei predicts 1) in which of the 13 subnuclear compartments a nuclear protein is located and 2) whether a nuclear protein is also located in another compartment outside the nucleus (traveller proteins).
LocNuclei combines homology-based inference if possbile with a de nove prediction using a string-based Profile Kernel SVM otherwise.

## Requirements
LocNuclei is a Python project. To run LocNuclei, Python 3 has to be installed locally.
